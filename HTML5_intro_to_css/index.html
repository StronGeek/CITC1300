        <h1> Dark Souls </h1>
        <p>"Are you prepared to die?" Those are the first words that come to mind with a game as iconic as Dark Souls. In the world of Dark Souls, you are a hollow, an undead who will never know peace. The world is dying, and flame, the power that gave strength to the inhabitants of the world, is dying. Your journey is to set out to link the flame. On this journey you must batlle fellow undead who have gone hollow, as well as former heroes and even gods to achieve your goal.</p>

    <h2>"Be safe, friend. Dont you dare go hollow."</h2>
    <p>The heading above is a quote from Laurentius, a friendly npc you can meet and learn the art of pyromancy from. But what exactly is hollowing? Hollowing is the gradual process of going mad from losing all sense of self. It is a result of losing all ambition and goals. Even friendly npcs that go hollow become hostile and attack anything in sight. Your only hope is to remember your purpose and persevere, lest you become hollow yourself. </p>
