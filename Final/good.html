    <h1> Good Factions</h1>
    <p>Join the forces of good in their fight against evil. Control the valiant Riders of Rohan and the noble Soldiers of Gondor as you defend against the forces of Mordor and Isengard.</p>

    <h2>Rohan</h2>
    <p style="color:rgb(212, 78, 170)">Align yourself with the force of Rohan and feel the power of their cavalry. They are able to trample most enemies and and make the enemy think twice before engaging. They also have the Most Heroes to choose from, allowing for a true cinematic experience. With the leadership the Heroes provide as well as the cavalry's ability to trample foes, they make for a formidable force.</p>
    <h2>Gondor</h2>
    <p style="color:rgb(212, 78, 170)">Join with the forces of Gondor and repel the forces of evil. The use of Trebuchets combined with their rangers and Tower Guards makes them a powerhouse. The wizard Gandalf is avaible as a hero for this faction, which in many cases will turn the tide of battle. </p>
