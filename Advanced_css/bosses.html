                <P>Gravelord Nito is one of the main bosses in Dark Souls. One of the original lords of cinder, Nito holds the power over death. They reside in the catacombs, a place where skeletons and necromancers alike call their home, away from the light. When you fight them, it will be in thier own grave. Nito will summon skeletons and use the power of Thier Geavelord Greatsword, as well as death to win. Nito is the easiest of the Four Lords to fight.</P>
