    <h1>Black Dragon Kalameet</h1>
    <p>Black Dragon Kalameet is a descendant of the Primordial Archdragons, the original Dragons. He is one of the toughest bosses in the game, with resistances to all elements and a large health pool. Killing him gives you the calamity ring, a ring thats only effect makes you take more damage. Miyazaki loves to troll his players, and this is a perfect example of his sense of humor.</p>

    <h3>The Everlasting Dragon</h3>
    <p>The Everlasting Dragon is an interesting beast. Not an actual enemy, it is located at the very bottom of the depths, through a treacherous climb down a giant tree swamring with enemies. Those who brave the journey to the bottom may pray to them and be granted admission to the Path of The Dragon Convenant. It is unkillable but you can cut off his tail to gain the Dragon Greatsword.</p>
